			<p class="mb-4 indent-8">Nearly all programming languages have some way to print text to the screen. In lua, we do this using the `print` function. We'll learn more about what functions are and how they work later, but for now, all you need to know is that if you write `print()`, and put a message in quotation marks between the parenthesis, it will print that message (without the quotes) to the output.</p>
